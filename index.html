          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I&rsquo;m a front end developer with more than 5 years&rsquo; experience crafting interesting and unusual websites which are on-brand and responsive.</p>
          <h4>I create...</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>succinct, semantially decisive HTML</li>
            <li>Javascript that&rsquo;s both creative and sensible</li>
            <li>CSS backed by a &ldquo;breadth and specificity&rdquo; of skills (according to a client)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Together, these three skills help me to create websites that are accessible, usable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;m obsessed with code. I set up <a href="http://fesuffolk.co.uk">FESuffolk</a>, a front-end user group based in my home town of Ipswich. The group meets every month to talk tech and share presentations based on front-end development and design.</p>
          <p>On top of this, I&rsquo;m always reading and researching around my field. I&rsquo;m adept at spotting and embracing the best new techniques, and avoiding the ones that are just fads. As a result, I&rsquo;m confident that the work I deliver to my clients is always cutting-edge.</p>

          <h3>FESuffolk</h3>
          <p>I've been running a front end user group in my home town of Ipswich in suffolk. Every month developers and designers meet to talk tech and share presentations based on front end development and design. These meet-ups have helped with the cross pollination of ideas and the understanding of new development concepts. <a href='http://fesuffolk.co.uk'>read more about FESuffolk here</a>.</p>
          <h3>Victoria Guthrie</h3>
          <p>Vick needed a quick landing page to promote herself online. A responsive landing page went from an idea and some copy to live site in just a few hours.<a href='http://victoriaguthrie.co.uk'>See the Website</a>.</p>
          <h3>Drag the Dots</h3>
          <p>In late 2013 I developed a phonegap puzzle game for iOS and Android, it was warmly recieved and was a great experiment in mobile app design.

          <h3>Duckie</h3>
          <p>As part of a one day hack myself and Matthew bennett made rubber ducking as a service, a client side web app that asks informative questions about development problems.
