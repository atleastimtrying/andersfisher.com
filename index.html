          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Anders is a passionate and curious developer who has decided to focus himself on development for the front end of websites. Over the last five years he has honed his craft.

His Javascript is both sensible and creative, approaching problems by making the best use of his ever expanding knowledge.

Anders is constantly reading and researching in his field, embracing the best new techniques and discarding those which are merely fads &ndash; this means that he will always strive to keep his work at the cutting edge of web development.</p>

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <h3><a href='http://fesuffolk.co.uk'>FESuffolk</a></h3>
          <p>Anders has organised a front end based user group in his home town of Ipswich in suffolk. Every month developers and designers meet to talk tech and share presentations based on front end development and design. These meet-ups have helped with the cross pollination of ideas and the understanding of new development concepts.</p>
          <h3><a href='http://victoriaguthrie.co.uk'>Victoria Guthrie</a></h3>
          <p>Vick needed a quick landing page to promote herself online. A responsive landing page went from an idea and some copy to live site in just a few hours.</p>
          <h3><a href='http://atleastimtrying.github.com'>Github Pages</a></h3>
          <p>Anders keeps many of his smaller projects on Github. He was keen to host and show these little experiments so a simple landing page making use of the best of CSS3 was in order!</p>
