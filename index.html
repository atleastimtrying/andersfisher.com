          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Anders is a passionate and curious developer who has decided to focus himself on development for the front end of websites. Using the traditional materials of his trade over the last five years he has honed his craft. His HTML is semantically decisive and succinct as well as both expressive and eloquent. His Javascript is both sensible and creative, approaching problems by making the best use of his ever expanding knowledge. Anders has been commended on both the breadth and specificity of his CSS skills.</p>
          <p>The combination of these three mean that he is capable of creating interesting and unusual, on brand and responsive websites which are both accessible and aesthetically pleasing. Anders is constantly reading and researching in his field, embracing the best new techniques and discarding those which are merely fads &ndash; this means that he will always strive to keep his work at the cutting edge of web development.</p>

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <h3><a href='http://fesuffolk.co.uk'>FESuffolk</a></h3>
          <p>I have organised a front end based user group in my home town of Ipswich in suffolk. Every month we meet to talk tech and have presentations based on front end development and design. These meet ups have helped with the cross pollination of ideas and the understanding of new development concepts.</p>
          <h3><a href='http://js-dev.co.uk'>JS Dev</a></h3>
          <p>JS Dev is a curated resource of links associated with front end development. I will be regularly updating the site with useful and interesting information.</p>
          <h3><a href='http://victoriaguthrie.co.uk'>Victoria Guthrie</a></h3>
          <p>Vick Needed a quick landing page to promote herself online, a responsive landing page went from idea and copy to live site in a few hours.</p>
          <h3><a href='http://atleastimtrying.github.com'>Github Pages</a></h3>
          <p>I tend to keep a lot of smaller projects on github, I was keen to host and show these little experiments so a simple landing page making use of the best of CSS3 was in order!</p>
